Usage
----

[`SizeClasser`](https://github.com/cemolcay/SizeClasser/blob/master/SizeClasser/SizeClasser.swift) is an `OptionSet` type struct.  
You can initialize it with your viewController's `traitCollection` property to identify your current device specific orientation and split view status.

``` swift
let sizeClasser = SizeClasser(traitCollection: traitCollection)
```

Options:

``` swift
/// Screen height is bigger than width. Portrait mode in all devices.
public static let portrait = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 0)
/// Screen width is bigger than height. Landscape mode in all devices.
public static let landscape = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 1)
/// Portrait mode for iPhone devices.
public static let iPhonePortrait = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 2)
/// Landscape mode for iPhone devices.
public static let iPhoneLandscape = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 3)
/// Portrait mode for iPad devices.
public static let iPadPortrait = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 4)
/// Landscape mode for iPad devices.
public static let iPadLandscape = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 5)
/// Split mode 1/3 of visible area in iPad devices.
public static let iPadSplitOneThird = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 8)
/// Split mode 1/2 of visible area in iPad devices.
public static let iPadSplitHalf = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 9)
/// Split mode 2/3 of visible area in iPad devices.
public static let iPadSplitTwoThird = SizeClasser(rawValue: 1 << 10)
```
  
For example, if you want to detect iPad split view 1/3 on landscape orientation, simply:

``` swift
guard let trait = SizeClasser(traitCollection: traitCollection) else { return }
if trait.contains([.iPadLandscape, .iPadSplitOneThird]) {
  // You are on iPad, landscape and 1/3 split view mode
  if SizeClasser.isiPadPro {
    // You are on 12.9" iPad
  } else {
    // You are on regular iPad / iPad mini
  }
}
```

Also you can use `SizeClasser.isiPadPro` to detect 12.9" iPad Pro if you want to layout your views more specifically.  

#### Note on `traitCollectionDidChange:previousTraitCollection` function:
This function only get called if `traitCollection` changes.  
If you are on iPad, either portrait or landscape mode, it won't change 1/3 split view to 2/3 split view transitions.  
iOS calculates them both `compact width regular height` mode.  
So, I recommend to use `viewDidLayoutSubviews:` function to detect split view changes specifically.
